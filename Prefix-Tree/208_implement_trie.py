This implementation supports insertion of words, exact word search, and prefix-based search.

--> Time Complexity
- insert(word): O(n), where n is the length of the word
- search(word): O(n), where n is the length of the word
- startsWith(prefix): O(k), where k is the length of the prefix

--> Space Complexity
- O(n * m) in the worst case, where n is the number of inserted words and m is the average word length
- Each node uses a dictionary to store child references, which can grow up to 26 keys in the case of lowercase English letters

Key Details:
- Each `Node` represents a character and maintains a dictionary of child nodes and an `end` flag to mark completion of a word
- The `insert()` method builds the trie by creating new nodes for unseen characters
- The `search()` method returns `True` only if the word exists and ends at a valid word boundary
- The `startsWith()` method checks if a prefix path exists in the trie, regardless of whether itâ€™s a full word

This Trie implementation is efficient for dictionary-like use cases, autocomplete systems, and prefix-based searches.
