This solution implements a **Time-Based Key-Value Store**.

For each key, we store a list of (value, timestamp) pairs sorted by timestamp.
- `set()` stores the value with its timestamp.
- `get()` retrieves the value with the **largest timestamp â‰¤ the given timestamp**.

Since timestamps are strictly increasing for each key, binary search can be used efficiently to perform the get operation.

--> Time Complexity

1. set(key, value, timestamp)
- Appending to the list takes O(1) time since we maintain values in order.
- Total Time Complexity: **O(1)**

2. get(key, timestamp)
- Performs binary search over the list of (value, timestamp) pairs.
- Let n = number of values stored for `key`.
- Binary Search: O(log n)
- Total Time Complexity: **O(log n)**

--> Space Complexity

- A dictionary where each key maps to a list of (value, timestamp) pairs.
- Let m = number of unique keys, and total number of set calls be N.
- Space used: O(N), where N is the total number of key-value pairs stored.

This implementation ensures fast retrieval and is optimal for time-based queries.
