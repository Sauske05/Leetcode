'''
In this approach, we use two auxiliary arrays: max_left and max_right.
Each stores the maximum height to the left and right of every index, respectively.

--> Time Complexity
The algorithm runs in O(n) time:
- One pass to fill max_left
- One pass to fill max_right
- One pass to calculate trapped water

--> Space Complexity
O(n) space is required to store the max_left and max_right arrays.


While the solution is correct and intuitive, it's suboptimal in terms of space.
It uses O(n) extra space, which can be avoided. The two-pointer technique is preferred.

'''
This is the optimal two-pointer approach.

--> Time Complexity
The algorithm runs in O(n) time:
- Single pass with two pointers traversing from both ends

--> Space Complexity
O(1) additional space is used since we donâ€™t store extra arrays


This solution is optimal because it avoids extra memory usage.
It dynamically tracks left_max and right_max and accumulates trapped water 
based on the lower side, ensuring correctness in one pass.
