Welcome to my LeetCode solutions repository! This project contains my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems, written as part of my coding practice and preparation for technical interviews. The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, understand algorithms and data structures, and share my progress with others.

### About

* Purpose: A collection of solutions to LeetCode problems, coded primarily in Python.

* Focus: Emphasis on clear, efficient, and well-commented code to solve algorithmic challenges.

* Problems: Solutions cover a range of topics, including arrays, strings, linked lists, trees, dynamic programming, graphs, and more.


### Structure
Each solution is organized in a separate file, named by the LeetCode problem number and title (e.g., 001_two-sum.py).

### Files include:

* Brief problem description (in my own words).

* My solution with comments explaining the approach.

* Time and space complexity analysis.
